# Contributing
Bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests are welcome!

Please try to match your code style to the existing codebase. If you think a change in that style is warranted, feel free to make a suggestion in a new Issue. 

**For new contributions please use functional components** unless you have good reason to use struct components. It is the [recommended default from Yew](https://yew.rs/docs/concepts/function-components)[^1], and we should be consistent. 
[^1]: > function components - the recommended way to write components when starting with Yew and when writing simple presentation logic.

Please be sure to try `cargo test` before submitting a PR.

All new features should have examples in their documentation via doc strings as well as an example application under `/examples/`.
